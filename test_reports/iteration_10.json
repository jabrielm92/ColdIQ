  "summary": "Completed testing of ColdIQ feature expansion (Starter/Pro tiers to 100%). All backend tests passed (24/24). Fixed missing Target icon import in AnalysisMetrics.jsx. Server-side analysis metrics (readability, spam, CTA, subject) work correctly for Starter+. Fix Suggestions with priority badges (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) display correctly. Performance page with time range selector (7D/30D/90D) works for Pro users. Sequence Analysis page allows adding/removing emails and analyzing multi-email sequences. Growth Agency 'Contact Us' redirects to /contact form which submits successfully. Sidebar shows PRO badges for Pro-only features. Free/Starter users see locked state on Performance and Sequence pages.",
